## Contribution Workflow

The contribution process depends on the size and scope of your change. Even when not required, opening an issue is a great way to start a conversation with Dynamo maintainers before investing time in a PR.

| Size | Lines Changed | Example | What You Need |
|------|---------------|---------|---------------|
| **XS** | 1–10 | Typo fix, config tweak | Submit a PR directly |
| **S** | 10–100 | Small bug fix, doc improvement, focused refactor | Submit a PR directly |
| **M** | 100–200 | Feature addition, moderate refactor | [Open an issue](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/new?template=contribution_request.yml) first |
| **L** | 200–500 | Multi-file feature, new component | [Open an issue](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/new?template=contribution_request.yml) first |
| **XL** | 500–1000 | Major feature, cross-component change | [Open an issue](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/new?template=contribution_request.yml) first |
| **XXL** | 1000+ | Architecture change | Requires a [DEP](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/enhancements) |

**Small changes (under 100 lines):** Submit a PR directly -- no issue needed. This includes typos, simple bug fixes, and formatting. If your PR addresses an existing approved issue, link it with "Fixes #123".

**Larger changes (≥100 lines):** [Open a Contribution Request](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/new?template=contribution_request.yml) issue first and wait for the `approved-for-pr` label before submitting a PR.

**Architecture changes:** Changes that affect multiple components, introduce or modify public APIs, alter communication plane architecture, or affect backend integration contracts require a [Dynamo Enhancement Proposal (DEP)](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/enhancements). Open a DEP in the [`ai-dynamo/enhancements`](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/enhancements) repo before starting implementation.

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Create a GitHub Issue** (if required) — [Open a Contribution Request](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/issues/new?template=contribution_request.yml) and describe what you're solving, your proposed approach, estimated PR size, and files affected.

2. **Get Approval** — Wait for maintainers to review and apply the `approved-for-pr` label.

3. **Submit a Pull Request** — [Open a PR](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/compare) that references the issue using GitHub keywords (e.g., "Fixes #123").

4. **Address Code Rabbit Review** — Respond to automated Code Rabbit suggestions, including nitpicks.

5. **Trigger CI Tests** — For external contributors, a maintainer must comment `/ok to test COMMIT-ID` to run the full CI suite, where `COMMIT-ID` is the short SHA of your latest commit. Fix any failing tests before requesting human review.

6. **Request Review** — Add the person who approved your issue as a reviewer. Check [CODEOWNERS](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/CODEOWNERS) for required approvers based on files modified.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **AI-Generated Code:** While we encourage using AI tools, you must fully understand every change in your PR. Inability to explain submitted code will result in rejection.

### Branch Naming

Use a descriptive branch name that identifies you and the change:

```text
yourname/fix-description
```

Examples:

```text
jsmith/fix-router-timeout
jsmith/add-lora-support
```

---

## Code Style & Quality

Maintainers assess contribution quality based on code style, test coverage, architecture alignment, and review responsiveness. Consistent, high-quality contributions are the foundation for building trust in the project.

### Pre-commit Hooks

All PRs are checked against [pre-commit hooks](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml). After [installing pre-commit](#set-up-pre-commit-hooks), run checks locally:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Commit Message Conventions

Use [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) prefixes:

| Prefix | Use For |
|--------|---------|
| `feat:` | New features |
| `fix:` | Bug fixes |
| `docs:` | Documentation changes |
| `refactor:` | Code refactoring (no behavior change) |
| `test:` | Adding or updating tests |
| `chore:` | Maintenance, dependency updates |
| `ci:` | CI/CD changes |
| `perf:` | Performance improvements |

Examples:

```text
feat(router): add weighted load balancing
fix(frontend): resolve streaming timeout on large responses
docs: update quickstart for macOS users
test(planner): add unit tests for scaling policy
```

### Language Conventions

| Language | Style Guide | Formatter |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Python** | [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) | `black`, `ruff` |
| **Rust** | [Rust API Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/) | `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy` |
| **Go** | [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) | `gofmt` |

### Testing

Run the test suite before submitting a PR:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run unit tests only
pytest -m unit tests/

# Run a specific test file
pytest -s -v tests/test_example.py
```

For Rust components:

```bash
cargo test
```

For the Kubernetes operator (Go):

```bash
cd deploy/operator
go test ./... -v
```

### General Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused -- one concern per PR
- Write clean, well-documented code that future contributors can understand
- Include tests for new functionality and bug fixes
- Ensure clean builds (no warnings or errors)
- All tests must pass
- No commented-out code
- Respond to review feedback promptly and constructively

### Running GitHub Actions Locally

Use [act](https://nektosact.com/) to run workflows locally:

```bash
act -j pre-merge-rust
```

Or use the [GitHub Local Actions](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SanjulaGanepola.github-local-actions) VS Code extension.
