This guide demonstrates how to deploy Llama 4 Maverick Instruct with Eagle Speculative Decoding on GB200x4 nodes. We will be following the [multi-node deployment instructions](./multinode/trtllm-multinode-examples.md) to set up the environment for the following scenarios:

- **Aggregated Serving:**
  Deploy the entire Llama 4 model on a single GB200x4 node for end-to-end serving.

- **Disaggregated Serving:**
  Distribute the workload across two GB200x4 nodes:
    - One node runs the decode worker.
    - The other node runs the prefill worker.

## Notes
* Make sure the (`eagle3_one_model: true`) is set in the LLM API config inside the `examples/backends/trtllm/engine_configs/llama4/eagle` folder.

## Setup

Assuming you have already allocated your nodes via `salloc`, and are
inside an interactive shell on one of the allocated nodes, set the
following environment variables based:

```bash
cd $DYNAMO_HOME/examples/backends/trtllm

export IMAGE="<dynamo_trtllm_image>"
# export MOUNTS="${PWD}/:/mnt,/lustre:/lustre"
export MOUNTS="${PWD}/:/mnt"
export MODEL_PATH="nvidia/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8"
export SERVED_MODEL_NAME="nvidia/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8"
```

See the [multinode setup instructions](./multinode/trtllm-multinode-examples.md#setup) to learn more about the above options.


## Aggregated Serving
```bash
export NUM_NODES=1
export ENGINE_CONFIG="/mnt/examples/backends/trtllm/engine_configs/llama4/eagle/eagle_agg.yml"
./multinode/srun_aggregated.sh
```

## Disaggregated Serving

```bash
export NUM_PREFILL_NODES=1
export PREFILL_ENGINE_CONFIG="/mnt/examples/backends/trtllm/engine_configs/llama4/eagle/eagle_prefill.yml"
export NUM_DECODE_NODES=1
export DECODE_ENGINE_CONFIG="/mnt/examples/backends/trtllm/engine_configs/llama4/eagle/eagle_decode.yml"
./multinode/srun_disaggregated.sh
```

## Example Request

See the [example request section](./multinode/trtllm-multinode-examples.md#example-request) to learn how to send a request to the deployment.
