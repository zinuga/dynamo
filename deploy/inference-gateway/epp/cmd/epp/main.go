// Dynamo EPP - Custom Endpoint Picker Plugin for NVIDIA Dynamo
//
// This EPP integrates with the Gateway API Inference Extension to provide
// KV-aware routing for Dynamo inference backends.
//
// # Header-Based Routing
//
// The Dynamo KV scorer sets routing headers that the Lua filter at the
// gateway uses to inject nvext into the request body:
//
//   - x-worker-instance-id: Selected worker ID (decode worker in disagg mode)
//   - x-prefiller-host-port: Prefill worker ID (disaggregated mode only)
//   - x-dynamo-routing-mode: "aggregated" or "disaggregated"
//
// The Lua filter reads these headers and injects:
//   - Aggregated: {"nvext": {"backend_instance_id": <worker_id>}}
//   - Disaggregated: {"nvext": {"prefill_worker_id": <prefill>, "decode_worker_id": <decode>}}
