                      will be sent to this specific worker and router states will be
                      updated accordingly.

                    the request will be routed to the specific (worker_id, dp_rank) pair.
                    If only dp_rank is set, the router will select the best worker but
                    force routing to the specified dp_rank.

                       PreprocessedRequest.
            block_mm_infos: Optional block-level multimodal metadata aligned to
                           request blocks. Backward-compatible shortcut; this is
                           converted to mm_routing_info with routing_token_ids=token_ids.
            multi_modal_data: Optional multimodal payload map to preserve image/video
                             data for downstream model execution.
            mm_routing_info: Optional structured routing-only multimodal payload

              to the specified worker while still updating router states.
            - dp_rank allows targeting a specific data parallel replica when workers have
              multiple replicas (data_parallel_size > 1).
            - This is different from query_instance_id which doesn't route the request.
