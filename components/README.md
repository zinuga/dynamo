# Dynamo Components

This directory contains the core components that make up the Dynamo inference framework. Each component serves a specific role in the distributed LLM serving architecture, enabling high-throughput, low-latency inference across multiple nodes and GPUs.

## Core Components

### Backends

Dynamo supports multiple inference engines, each with their own deployment configurations and capabilities:

- **[vLLM](/docs/backends/vllm/README.md)** - Full-featured vLLM integration with disaggregated serving, KV-aware routing, SLA-based planning, native KV cache events, and NIXL-based transfer mechanisms
- **[SGLang](/docs/backends/sglang/README.md)** - SGLang engine integration with ZMQ-based communication, supporting disaggregated serving and KV-aware routing
- **[TensorRT-LLM](/docs/backends/trtllm/README.md)** - TensorRT-LLM integration with disaggregated serving capabilities and TensorRT acceleration

Each engine provides launch and deploy scripts for different deployment patterns in the [examples](../examples/backends/) folder.


### [Frontend](src/dynamo/frontend/)

The frontend component provides the HTTP API layer and request processing:

- **OpenAI-compatible HTTP server** - RESTful API endpoint for LLM inference requests
- **Pre-processor** - Handles request preprocessing and validation
- **Router** - Routes requests to appropriate workers based on load and KV cache state
- **Auto-discovery** - Automatically discovers and registers available workers

### [Planner](src/dynamo/planner/)

The planner component monitors system state and dynamically adjusts worker allocation:

- **Dynamic scaling** - Scales prefill/decode workers up and down based on metrics
- **SLA-based planning** - Ensures inference performance targets are met
- **Load-based planning** - Optimizes resource utilization based on demand

## Getting Started

To get started with Dynamo components:

1. **Choose an inference engine** from the supported backends
2. **Set up required services** (etcd and NATS) using Docker Compose
3. **Configure** your chosen engine using Python wheels or building an image
4. **Run deployment scripts** from the engine's launch directory
5. **Monitor performance** using the metrics component

For detailed instructions, see the README files in each component directory and the main [Dynamo documentation](../docs/).
