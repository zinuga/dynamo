    will manage a pre-allocated buffer, so its NIXL metadata is consistent once
    initialized. In such acenarios, let sender initiate the WRITE operations requires
    minimal metadata exchange.

    Protocol:
        1. Record the receiver NIXL metadata, this is done:
            * Implicitly through the first transfer request as fallback if the metadata
              hasn't been recorded.
            * [REMOVED] Explicitly through add_agent() API before calling send_embeddings().
              The receiver provides get_agent_metadata() API to return its NIXL metadata.
              This complicates the implementation and add extra responsiblity on the caller side,
              will revisit the necessity if metadata exchange overhead is significant.
        2. The sender prepares the embeddings and produces a TransferRequest
           containing sender contact and tensor metadata (shape, dtype, size, etc).
        3. The receiver responds with (optional) receiver contact, target tensor
           metadata (buffer address, device, etc) and done signal through NIXL notification.
